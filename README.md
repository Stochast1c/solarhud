solarhud
==========

A solarized themed hud for TF2 that is heavily based on Ell's Hud using the Inconsolata Font

The main goal of this mod is to completely overwrite all colors and fonts
   while keeping the minimal but very legible style of ell's hud.

This HUD is tailored for 6s players and surfers, though a few easy tweaks will make it work for pub and HL players.  Minmode 0 is for the 6s hud and Minmode 1 is for the surfing HUD.  

It is highly recommended that you clone the hud rather than download and extract the zip
   This hud is under constant renovation until everything has been converted
   and modified to an acceptable standard

   tournament mode ready
   tournament mode gui
