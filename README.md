solarhud
==========

A solarized themed hud for TF2 that is heavily based on Ell's Hud using the Inconsolata Font

The main goal of this mod is to completely overwrite all colors and fonts
   while keeping the minimal but very legible style of ell's hud.

This HUD is tailored for 6s players and surfers, though a few easy tweaks will make it work for pub and HL players.  Minmode 0 is for the 6s hud and Minmode 1 is for the surfing HUD.

#How to Switch Themes

To switch between light and dark colorschemes (the default is light), swap the base colors in source and client scheme: base0<->base00, base3<->base03.

Then change the map in scripts/chapterbackgrounds.txt: upward<->2fort.

#Requests, Bugs, Errors, etc.

If there is an unmodified element or an element that you want modified different, submit an issue, or if you feel industrious enough, modify it yourself and create a pull request.

If an element isn't displaying properly, submit an issue, preferably with a screenshot, with your resolution and a description of the problem.

If you see a color that is not in the solarized colorscheme or an element that is oddly colored magenta raise an issue (preferably with a screenshot) as these are elements that I thought were not able to be modified.

It is highly recommended that you clone the hud rather than download and extract the zip.  This hud is under constant renovation until everything has been converted and modified to an acceptable standard.
