solarhud
==========

A solarized themed hud for TF2 that is heavily based on Ell's Hud using the Inconsolata Font

The main goal of this mod is to completely overwrite all colors and fonts
   while keeping the minimal but very legible style of ell's hud.

This HUD is tailored for 6s players and surfers, though a few easy tweaks will make it work for pub and HL players.  Minmode 0 is for the 6s hud and Minmode 1 is for the surfing HUD.  

It is highly recommended that you clone the hud rather than download and extract the zip
   This hud is under constant renovation until everything has been converted
   and modified to an acceptable standard

Major things left to do:
   tournament mode ready - done except font for textentry for team name, clientscheme???
   tournament mode spec gui
   control points - trying to blow up the images looks horrible with their border, try if you can use editablepanels or if changing the border works
   koth timers
   winpanel - override team color definition
   stopwatch mode timer
   outline popup panels (serverbrowser, console, options, etc.)
   team selection - done to a working state
   class selection - dont to a working state
   item charge
   demo stickies
   loading menu - colored, added font, need to remove giant bg panels and modify the stats panel
   motd menu - removed completely, may consider adding back if I can change the source to the most recent tf.tv news
